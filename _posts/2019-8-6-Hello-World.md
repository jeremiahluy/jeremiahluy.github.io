title: This will be the first post to the site!

This first post will just be to test whether or not I have the GitHub pages figured out already. It actually took me a couple of days - believe me or not. But, I think that GitHub would be a sensible page to host my personal site since it will also contain my projects. Thank you for taking the time to visit! Feel free to send me a message to talk about anything.
